            <h2>History of TechCon</h2>
            <p>
                TechCon began in 1996 in New Orleans as a technical forum focused on advancing electrical grid technologies. Organized by TJ|H2b Analytical Services, it quickly became a trusted event for utility hosts, engineers, and industry leaders focused on high-voltage maintenance and asset management.

                In the late 1990s and early 2000s, TechCon expanded geographically and broadened its audience to include a diverse mix of professionals such as technology directors, insurers, and manufacturers. This growth helped build a strong technical community across North America through a traveling conference model.

It emphasizes cross-industry collaboration, spotlighting blockchain, fintech, and AI innovations in government, business, and education. African editions now attract leaders from multiple nations and sectors.
